# Portfolio-Website
I made this website using ReactJS, SCSS ,Sanity.io
To run this project, first go to backend-sanity directory using #cd backend-sanity
Then run #sanity start
This will start the backtend part of the project i.e, sanity.io
After that open a new terminal and go to frontend-react directory using #cd frontend-react
Then run #npm start
This will start the frontend part of the project
And enjoy this portfolio website.
If this project helped you in learning a little, do give a thumbs-up(like) to this project.
THANK YOU
